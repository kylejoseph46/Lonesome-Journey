# Lonesome-Journey
Lonesome Journey is a text based video game created in Python about a boy lost in the wilderness trying to make his way home. On his way home he has to get across many obstacles from crossing vast plains and rivers to fighting dragons. I've taken inspiration from Final Fantasy I from the NES. (Work in Progress).
